abstract = {Introduction
Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (TI, TIS, or tTIS), also known as interferential stimulation (IFS), is able to focally stimulate deep brain regions, provided it is properly optimized. We previously presented an algorithm for optimizing TI using two arrays of electrodes and showed that it can achieve more focal stimulation compared to optimized high-definition transcranial electrical stimulation (HD-TES) and conventional optimized TI using two pairs of electrodes, especially in the deep brain areas such as the hippocampus. However, those modeling studies were only performed on an averaged head (MNI152 template) and three individual heads without exploring inter-individual variability. Existing TI works in the literature mostly utilize a common (possibly optimized) montage of two pairs of electrodes on different individual heads without considering inter-individual variability. Material and method: Here we aim to study the inter-individual variability of optimized TI by applying the same optimization algorithms on N = 25 heads using their individualized head models. Specifically, we compared the focality achieved by different stimulation techniques at six different regions of interest (ROI; right hippocampus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left motor cortex, right amygdala, right caudate, and left thalamus) under both individually optimized and unoptimized montages. We also conducted numerical sensitivity analysis on the individual optimization and performed phantom recordings to test our models.
Results
As expected, there is a variability in focality achieved by TI of up to 1.2 cm at the same ROI across subjects due to inter-individual differences in the head anatomy and tissue conductivity. We show that optimized TI using two arrays of electrodes achieves higher focality than that from optimized HD-TES at the same level of modulation intensity at 5 of the 6 ROIs. Compared to using a common montage either optimized from the MNI152 template or from the literature, individually optimized TI using two pairs of electrodes improves the focality by up to 4.4 cm, and by up to 1.1 cm if using two arrays of electrodes. Focality achieved by the individual optimization is sensitive to random changes and can vary up to 9.3 cm due to the non-lienarity of TI physics. Experimental recordings on a head phantom confirms the drop in TI stimulation strength when using unoptimized montages as predicted by our in silico models.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates the need of individually optimizing TI to target deep brain areas, and advocates against using a common head model and montage for TI modeling and experimental studies.},

	abstract = {This work aims to perform a cross-site validation of automated segmentation for breast cancers in MRI and to compare the performance to radiologists. A three-dimensional (3D) U-Net was trained to segment cancers in dynamic contrast-enhanced axial MRIs using a large dataset from Site 1 (n = 15,266; 449 malignant and 14,817 benign). Performance was validated on site-specific test data from this and two additional sites, and common publicly available testing data. Four radiologists from each of the three clinical sites provided two-dimensional (2D) segmentations as ground truth. Segmentation performance did not differ between the network and radiologists on the test data from Sites 1 and 2 or the common public data (median Dice score Site 1, network 0.86 vs. radiologist 0.85, n = 114; Site 2, 0.91 vs. 0.91, n = 50; common: 0.93 vs. 0.90). For Site 3, an affine input layer was fine-tuned using segmentation labels, resulting in comparable performance between the network and radiologist (0.88 vs. 0.89, n = 42). Radiologist performance differed on the common test data, and the network numerically outperformed 11 of the 12 radiologists (median Dice: 0.85–0.94, n = 20). In conclusion, a deep network with a novel supervised harmonization technique matches radiologists’ performance in MRI tumor segmentation across clinical sites. We make code and weights publicly available to promote reproducible AI in radiology.},

	issn = {1741-2552},
	abstract = {Objective. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and high-density electroencephalography require accurate models of current flow for precise targeting and current source reconstruction. At a minimum, such modeling must capture the idiosyncratic anatomy of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and skull for each individual subject. Currently, the process to build such high-resolution individualized models from structural magnetic resonance images requires labor-intensive manual segmentation, even when utilizing available automated segmentation tools. Also, accurate placement of many high-density electrodes on an individual scalp is a tedious procedure. The goal was to develop fully automated techniques to reduce the manual effort in such a modeling process. Approach. A fully automated segmentation technique based on Statical Parametric Mapping 8, including an improved tissue probability map and an automated correction routine for segmentation errors, was developed, along with an automated electrode placement tool for high-density arrays. The performance of these automated routines was evaluated against results from manual segmentation on four healthy subjects and seven stroke patients. The criteria include segmentation accuracy, the difference of current flow distributions in resulting HD-tDCS models and the optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets. Main results. The segmentation tool can segment out not just the brain but also provide accurate results for CSF, skull and other soft tissues with a field of view extending to the neck. Compared to manual results, automated segmentation deviates by only 7\% and 18\% for normal and stroke subjects, respectively. The predicted electric fields in the brain deviate by 12\% and 29\% respectively, which is well within the variability observed for various modeling choices. Finally, optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets do not differ significantly. Significance. Fully automated individualized modeling may now be feasible for large-sample EEG research studies and tDCS clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Individualized current-flow models are needed for precise targeting of brain structures using transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation (TES/TMS). The same is true for current-source reconstruction in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). The first step in generating such models is to obtain an accurate segmentation of individual head anatomy, including not only brain but also cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull and soft tissues, with a field of view (FOV) that covers the whole head. Currently available automated segmentation tools only provide results for brain tissues, have a limited FOV, and do not guarantee continuity and smoothness of tissues, which is crucially important for accurate current-flow estimates. Here we present a tool that addresses these needs. It is based on a rigorous Bayesian inference framework that combines image intensity model, anatomical prior (atlas) and morphological constraints using Markov random fields (MRF). The method is evaluated on 20 simulated and 8 real head volumes acquired with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1 mm3 resolution. We find improved surface smoothness and continuity as compared to the segmentation algorithms currently implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). With this tool, accurate and morphologically correct modeling of the whole-head anatomy for individual subjects may now be feasible on a routine basis. Code and data are fully integrated into SPM software tool and are made publicly available. In addition, a review on the MRI segmentation using atlas and the MRF over the last 20 years is also provided, with the general mathematical framework clearly derived.},

	volume = {140},
	issn = {1053-8119},
	abstract = {In source localization of electroencephalograpic (EEG) signals, as well as in targeted transcranial electric current stimulation (tES), a volume conductor model is required to describe the flow of electric currents in the head. Boundary element models (BEM) can be readily computed to represent major tissue compartments, but cannot encode detailed anatomical information within compartments. Finite element models (FEM) can capture more tissue types and intricate anatomical structures, but with the higher precision also comes the need for semi-automated segmentation, and a higher computational cost. In either case, adjusting to the individual human anatomy requires costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thus head modeling is often based on the anatomy of an ‘arbitrary’ individual (e.g. Colin27). Additionally, existing reference models for the human head often do not include the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), and their field of view excludes portions of the head and neck—two factors that demonstrably affect current-flow patterns. Here we present a highly detailed FEM, which we call ICBM-NY, or "New York Head". It is based on the ICBM152 anatomical template (a non-linear average of the MRI of 152 adult human brains) defined in MNI coordinates, for which we extended the field of view to the neck and performed a detailed segmentation of six tissue types (scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavities) at 0.5 mm 3 resolution. The model was solved for 231 electrode locations. To evaluate its performance, additional FEMs and BEMs were constructed for four individual subjects. Each of the four individual FEMs (regarded as the ‘ground truth’) is compared to its BEM counterpart, the ICBM-NY, a BEM of the ICBM anatomy, an ‘individualized’ BEM of the ICBM anatomy warped to the individual head surface, and FEMs of the other individuals. Performance is measured in terms of EEG source localization and tES targeting errors. Results show that the ICBM-NY outperforms FEMs of mismatched individual anatomies as well as the BEM of the ICBM anatomy according to both criteria. We therefore propose the New York Head as a new standard head model to be used in future EEG and tES studies whenever an individual MRI is not available. We release all model data online at neuralengr.com/nyhead/ to facilitate broad adoption.},

When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.4 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r=0.89) and depth (r=0.84) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.},

	abstract = {In large clinical centers a small subset of patients present with hydrocephalus that requires surgical treatment. We aimed to develop a screening tool to detect such cases from the head MRI with performance comparable to neuroradiologists. We leveraged 496 clinical MRI exams collected retrospectively at a single clinical site from patients referred for any reason. This diagnostic dataset was enriched to have 259 hydrocephalus cases. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on 16 manually segmented exams (ten hydrocephalus) and subsequently used to automatically segment the remaining 480 exams and extract volumetric anatomical features. A linear classifier of these features was trained on 240 exams to detect cases of hydrocephalus that required treatment with surgical intervention. Performance was compared to four neuroradiologists on the remaining 240 exams. Performance was also evaluated on a separate screening dataset of 451 exams collected from a routine clinical population to predict the consensus reading from four neuroradiologists using images alone. The pipeline was also tested on an external dataset of 31 exams from a 2nd clinical site. The most discriminant features were the Magnetic Resonance Hydrocephalic Index (MRHI), ventricle volume, and the ratio between ventricle and brain volume. At matching sensitivity, the specificity of the machine and the neuroradiologists did not show significant differences for detection of hydrocephalus on either dataset (proportions test, p {\textgreater} 0.05). ROC performance compared favorably with the state-of-the-art (AUC 0.90–0.96), and replicated in the external validation. Hydrocephalus cases requiring treatment can be detected automatically from MRI in a heterogeneous patient population based on quantitative characterization of brain anatomy with performance comparable to that of neuroradiologists.},

	abstract = {Purpose

To develop a deep network architecture that would achieve fully automated radiologist-level segmentation of cancers at breast MRI.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective study, 38 229 examinations (composed of 64 063 individual breast scans from 14 475 patients) were performed in female patients (age range, 12–94 years; mean age, 52 years ± 10 [standard deviation]) who presented between 2002 and 2014 at a single clinical site. A total of 2555 breast cancers were selected that had been segmented on two-dimensional (2D) images by radiologists, as well as 60 108 benign breasts that served as examples of noncancerous tissue; all these were used for model training. For testing, an additional 250 breast cancers were segmented independently on 2D images by four radiologists. Authors selected among several three-dimensional (3D) deep convolutional neural network architectures, input modalities, and harmonization methods. The outcome measure was the Dice score for 2D segmentation, which was compared between the network and radiologists by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the two one-sided test procedure.

Results

The highest-performing network on the training set was a 3D U-Net with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI as input and with intensity normalized for each examination. In the test set, the median Dice score of this network was 0.77 (interquartile range, 0.26). The performance of the network was equivalent to that of the radiologists (two one-sided test procedures with radiologist performance of 0.69–0.84 as equivalence bounds, P {\textless} .001 for both; n = 250).

Conclusion

When trained on a sufficiently large dataset, the developed 3D U-Net performed as well as fellowship-trained radiologists in detailed 2D segmentation of breast cancers at routine clinical MRI.},

	abstract = {Objective. Interferential stimulation (IFS) has generated considerable interest recently because of its potential to achieve focal electric fields in deep brain areas with transcranial currents. Conventionally, IFS applies sinusoidal currents through two electrode pairs with close-by frequencies. Here we propose to use an array of electrodes instead of just two electrode pairs; and to use algorithmic optimization to identify the currents required at each electrode to target a desired location in the brain. Approach. We formulate rigorous optimization criteria for IFS to achieve either maximal modulation-depth or maximally focal stimulation. We find the solution for optimal modulation-depth analytically and maximize for focal stimulation numerically. Main results. Maximal modulation is achieved when IFS equals conventional high-definition multi-electrode transcranial electrical stimulation (HD-TES) with a modulated current source. This optimal solution can be found directly from a current-flow model, i.e. the ‘lead field’ without the need for algorithmic optimization. Once currents are optimized numerically to achieve optimal focal stimulation, we find that IFS can indeed be more focal than conventional HD-TES, both at the cortical surface and deep in the brain. Generally, however, stimulation intensity of IFS is weak and the locus of highest intensity does not match the locus of highest modulation. Significance. This proof-of-principle study shows the potential of IFS over HD-TES for focal non-invasive deep brain stimulation. Future work will be needed to improve on intensity of stimulation and convergence of the optimization procedure.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1741-2552},
	abstract = {Objective. Research in the area of transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) often relies on computational models of current flow in the brain. Models are built based on magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human head to capture detailed individual anatomy. To simulate current flow on an individual, the subject’s MRI is segmented, virtual electrodes are placed on this anatomical model, the volume is tessellated into a mesh, and a finite element model (FEM) is solved numerically to estimate the current flow. Various software tools are available for each of these steps, as well as processing pipelines that connect these tools for automated or semi-automated processing. The goal of the present tool—realistic volumetric-approach to simulate transcranial electric simulation (ROAST)—is to provide an end-to-end pipeline that can automatically process individual heads with realistic volumetric anatomy leveraging open-source software and custom scripts to improve segmentation and execute electrode placement. Approach. ROAST combines the segmentation algorithm of SPM12, a Matlab script for touch-up and automatic electrode placement, the finite element mesher iso2mesh and the solver getDP. We compared its performance with commercial FEM software, and SimNIBS, a well-established open-source modeling pipeline. Main results. The electric fields estimated with ROAST differ little from the results obtained with commercial meshing and FEM solving software. We also do not find large differences between the various automated segmentation methods used by ROAST and SimNIBS. We do find bigger differences when volumetric segmentation are converted into surfaces in SimNIBS. However, evaluation on intracranial recordings from human subjects suggests that ROAST and SimNIBS are not significantly different in predicting field distribution, provided that users have detailed knowledge of SimNIBS. Significance. We hope that the detailed comparisons presented here of various choices in this modeling pipeline can provide guidance for future tool development. We released ROAST as an open-source, easy-to-install and fully-automated pipeline for individualized TES modeling.},

Here we attempted to provide an integrated solution for optimized tDCS to target multiple brain regions (either a single point or brain structures). By improving the “maxintensity” routine previously published in [1], we are able to target two regions of interest (ROI) in the brain simultaneously.For ROIs more than two, we show that the “max-focality” algorithm using weighted least-square in [1] can be further improved by putting the L1-norm constraint on the stimulation current as apenalty term into the cost function. Up to five ROIs can be targeted at the same time without violating the safety criteria. Further analysis shows that, for multiple targets, a trade-off exists between targeting accuracy and the number of electrodes needed.
